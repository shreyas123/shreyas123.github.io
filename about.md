I am a software professional currently working in [Shyftplan GmBH](https://shyftplan.de) as Development Director.

I have worked in IT industry for almost 9 years and 8 years of which was in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

The best way to describe me is my love for simple and logical coding. I believe in only one practice of developing any good code and that is doing through TDD/BDD.

I have worked on various other technologies like Java, C, PHP, python to name a few.

I have through knowledge of Elasticsearch and even wrote few plugins for it.

I currently reside in Berlin and when not coding I love to spend time either reading books or watching movies.

I work as freelancer so if you want to hire me contact me at <a href= "mailto:shreyas.agarwal@gmail.com">shreyas(dot)agarwal(at)gmail(dot)com</a>
